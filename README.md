# SpinProjects

This project contains a number of FV-1 effect programs that I have used on various
projects. Hardware designs are not included but you might find this code useful
for learning or hacking.

This code is hereby released into the public domain and can be used for any
purpose as long as the following conditions are met:

* You will not use the code as-is. Please tweak it for your particular needs. After
all, this code was already used on devices that were made so why would you want to just
make the same thing?

* There is no warranty or support of any kind. While I do my best to offer help with
the ElmGen tool that is used with these programs, the actual stuff here is completely
as-is and you're on your own if you want to use it.

This code can be built and flashed with the [ElmGen](https://github.com/hires/ElmGen)
software that is released for free by Andrew Kilpatrick.

Have fun!
